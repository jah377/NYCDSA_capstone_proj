# NYCDSA_capstone_proj
The following project was submitted as part of the NYC Data Science Academy (2020 cohort) with the intended purpose of exploring imbalanced datasets and logistic regression algorithms to improve the performance of simulated portfolios. Data obtained through Kaggle included 2.2M loans issued by LeandingClub online peer-to-peer lending, and over 100 features describing the loan and borrower. Data wrangling techniques, exploratory data analysis, and imbalanced classification machine learning techniques were utilized to help investors generate higher returns by identifying high-risk loans.
